##Infinite Expandability
With the setup, adding an action is as simple as writing code to detect it, then adding that option to the enum. Adding a reaction is equally easy: just write the method that should be triggered, then add it to the enum and executeReaction method.

##Contributing
Got an action or a reaction you want to add? Go for it! Feel free to message me with any questions you have about the code structure.
